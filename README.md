# DistributedComputerSystemsAssignment
Assignment for distributed computer systems module. 

This is an assignment I submitted as part of my degree. 

The objective was as follows:

>"The objective of this assignment is to address the problem of exchanging data using a
>subscription based system between distributed, potentially heterogeneous, computer systems.
>Such mechanisms are usually implemented as part of middleware packages in robotic or
>simulation systems to enable the sharing of data values.
>You are to design and implement a data subscription system for a general distributed
>environment."

Java RMI was used to create the distributed system, and the data item types that could be subscribed to were integers
in this example.
